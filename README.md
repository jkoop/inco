# Inco

Invoices and customers handling thing that I made to replace my awful system of a spreadsheet and directory of PDFs.

## Installation

Web server (I used Apache2), PHP 7, and some extensions:

| PHP extension | Apt package    |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| SQLite3       | php7.4-sqlite3 |

Your web server also needs write permission to the root of the project (the directory with `index.php` in it).
